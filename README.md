**Project Description: Tic Tac Toe Game**

This project is a web-based Tic Tac Toe game that offers a classic and engaging experience for two players. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it showcases fundamental web development techniques and provides a polished user interface.

### Features:

1. **HTML Structure**:
   - The HTML file defines the layout of the game, featuring a 3x3 grid of buttons that serve as the game board. Each button represents a cell where players can place their marks (X or O). The structure also includes message containers for displaying game results and buttons for resetting or starting a new game.

2. **CSS Styling**:
   - The CSS file ensures a clean and responsive design. It styles the game board, buttons, and text, providing a visually appealing interface. The styling adapts to different screen sizes, making the game accessible on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

3. **JavaScript Logic**:
   - The JavaScript file contains the core functionality of the game. It handles user interactions, such as clicking on cells and switching turns between players. The script checks for winning combinations using predefined patterns and displays a congratulatory message when a player wins. The game logic also includes disabling buttons once clicked and resetting the game state.

### Gameplay:

1. **Player Turns**:
   - Players take turns clicking on the grid cells to place their respective symbols. The first player uses "O," while the second player uses "X."

2. **Winning Detection**:
   - The game checks for winning combinations after each move. If a player aligns three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, they are declared the winner.

3. **Game Controls**:
   - The interface includes "Reset Game" and "New Game" buttons to restart the game at any point.

This project demonstrates essential skills in front-end web development, focusing on DOM manipulation, responsive design, and game logic implementation. It's a simple yet effective example of creating interactive web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
